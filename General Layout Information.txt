I basically divided the parts of the fuselage frame into
folders for each part. Each folder will include three part files:

-The "Part_Name_Mk# (Before Trimming)" file is the sketch
of the part without connecting the different shapes into a single
sketch. This allows for the relationships of the measurements to
be kept and therefore we can resize the part if needed.

-The "Part_Name_Mk#" file is the final sketch that will be used 
for the laser cutting of the part. This sketch is what the final 
part will look like and its the sketch that was used for the 
assembly file and test fitting. Note, the relationships in between
the measurements is not kept after the trimming so any resizing 
should be done in the "Part_Name_Mk# (Before Trimming)" file. 

- The "Part_Name_Mk# Assembly" file is the extruded version of 
the sketch that is used for the test fitting in the final assembly
of the fuselage frame. 

I also included the drawings of each part in the folders and will
include a .stl file of the extruded version of the part as well as 
a .dfx file of each part that can be used for laser cutting.
